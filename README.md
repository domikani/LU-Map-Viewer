# LU-Map-Viewer
This application is the final part of the Web GIS course, Lund University, Master Program in GIS. 
It is a web map service which covers the Municipality of Lund, Sweden and gives the guest theopportunity to explore specific spatial data. 
This application created using OpenLayers v5.3.0,GeoServer v2.15.1 and geographical data about Lund, sourced from Lund University 
and Lund Municipality.

#Geoserver, OpenLayers and node.js information:
In order to produce this application I used the developers production mode from OpenLayers.This mode uses node.js to develop 
an OpenLayers app in localhost:1234.More information about building an OpenLayers App can be found 
here https://openlayers.org/en/latest/doc/tutorials/bundle.html.To produce the geographical data from Lund Municipality in the application
I used GeoServer.
Please note my server does not run continuously.
